The year is 1916, Nikola Tesla is busily working in his lab perfecting his Tesla coil, technique of wireless charging along with all his
other unique inventions. Tesla enters his lab at 2 am on a warm summer night and is astounded to find a large metallic box that looks 
like an elevator in the center of his lab. It is about 10 feet tall with a large sliding glass plane, reinforced with a cool shiny metal 
on its edges. He finds this extremely unorthodox because he was the only one who had the keys to his lab. As Tesla slides open the glass 
pane and enters into the box, he finds a large dial inside the box with 4 digits along with a large red colored button that is soft to 
touch. He changes the numbers to 2020, hits the red button and ...... 

nothing happened. He jabbed at the button repeatedly, confused. He leans against the frame, which gave way with a groan, as Nikola 
comically took a tumble. The next thing he remembered, was waking up in his bed with a jolt. It was then that he felt his hands touch
something cold, as he looked down at his bed.. the mattress was no longer there,but instead the large metallic box that he witnessed
a few minutes ago in his dreaams...or was it a dream?

He frantically jumped out of bed clutching his hair. He looked around his lab and tried to recall the previous night. Wild with confusion, 
ran to draw the curtains. It was bright out. Almost too bright. He dressed himself, still in a haze of confusion. He sped through the hallways
eager to see to see the sky. He opened his door and the blinding light filled his dark house. He saw a huge white space filled with characters
that he couldn't comprehend. After his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw words like "COVID" and "Trump". He had no idea what those things meant
but he just thanked his stars that he was born in a much better time, back in 1916.
